# shopping-cart-management
This is a data structures and algorithms-driven shopping cart management system implemented in C++. The system allows users to manage store inventory, add or remove items from a persistent cart, apply optimal discount coupons using a priority queue (heap), and compute the final checkout amount efficiently.
